    "# ADTs\n",
    "\n",
    "Data structures can be viewed two ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In terms of their _concrete implementations_: for example, a fixed-size array, dynamic array, or linked list. These structures are defined by their representation in memory and the algorithms that implement their operations.\n",
    "2. In terms of what _abstract operations_ they support: for example, a stack might support `push`, `pop`, and `peek`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we take the latter view, we are considering the data structure as an **abstract data type (ADT)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "An ADT can have many potential implementations. For example, a stack can be implemented using arrays, linked lists, or even (in a contrived fashion) using dicts or numerous other underlying representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The O(n) performance of operations using any ADT implementation depends, of course, on the underlying representation, and how that representation is used to implement the ADT. Consider a stack implemented in two ways using a Python list:\n",
    "\n",
    "(A) Using the _front_ of the list as the \"top\" of the stack:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `push`: using Python list `insert` at index 0, takes O(N) time (we must shift all elements right)\n",
    "* `pop`: using Python `del` operator at index 0, takes O(N) time (we must shift remaining elements left)\n",
    "* `peek`: using Python indexing operator at index 0, takes O(1) time\n",
    "\n",
    "(B) Using the _back_ of the list as the \"top\" of the stack:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `push`: using Python list `append`, takes O(1) amortized time\n",
    "* `pop`: using Python list `pop`, takes O(1) amortized time\n",
    "* `peek`: using Python indexing operator at index 0, takes O(1) time\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, it's better to use the back as the top.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that although the _stack ADT_ operations can be phrased in terms of operations on the _Python list representation_, the two concepts are distinct; the stack is a facade or wrapper around the list. Code that that uses a stack --- the ADT's \"client\" --- should concern itself with the stack abstraction only, and have no access to the underlying list representation. In other words, the only code that should know about an an ADT implementation's representation is the implementation itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Protecting\" the representation of an abstraction from inappropriate access is called **encapsulation**. Different programming languages have different ways of encapsulating abstractions. In Python, the most common way is to define a class which keeps the representation \"hidden\" as one or more private fields of self. You can mark a field private by starting the name with one or two underscores:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyStack1:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self._rep = ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyStack2:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.__rep = ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the name \"rep\" is not special here; it is just a placeholder.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Aside: Some nitty-gritty Python details:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * Using one leading underscore for private fields is just a convention that has no special meaning to the Python interpreter, but signals to other programmers that client code should not touch these fields.\n",
    "> * Using two leading underscores instructs Python to \"mangle\" the name of this field so that it is hard to reference from outside of the class's members (but still possible).\n",
    ">\n",
    "> In either case, it is _possible_ for client code to access these fields, but only very bad programmers will access the private implementation of a Python class from outside that class (outside of certain situations like debugging or metaprogramming).\n",
    "\n",
    "Failing to encapsulate abstractions, or to respect abstraction boundaries, is **evil** --- **exposing** your **representation** has several bad effects. The primary one is that it _tightly couples_ your client code to your implementation code. If you decide to change something about how your implementation works, such as changing a private variable name, you may accidentally break clients. Conversely, if client code reaches into the implementation and mutates something, it may break some invariant that the implementation was depending on, and this defect can be hard to track down.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't do it!\n",
    "\n",
    "Exercises to test your understanding:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How would you implement the three stack ADT operations using a singly linked list?\n",
    "* How would you implement a stack using a dict and a counter variable?\n",

    "### Specifying an ADT \n",
    "\n",
    "When you specify an ADT, you should **never** have anything about the representation leaking into your specification.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **specification** is a **collection of procedural abstractions**, not a collection of procedures. In other words, the specification describes _the externally observable behavior_ of the abstraction, not about how the code implementing the abstraction works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, an ADT specifies interfaces (APIs) to\n",
    "\n",
    "- construct the ADT\n",
    "- add, manipulate, and access values in the ADT\n",
    "- destroy the ADT, cleaning up its resources if necessary (note that since Python is a garbage collected language, often it does not require an explicit operation to destroy the ADT)\n",
    "\n",
    "How should we write down the ADT specification?\n",
    "\n",
    "One way is the way we've used so far: to write it down in prose. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we could just say that a stack is a sequence supporting insertion and removal at one end. But this is fairly vague. Given this description, we have very little guidance on how to implement this abstraction (for example, what should the method names be called?), and equally little on how to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we wanted greater precision, we could enumerate the methods, and informally specify what each method should do. Often this is what we do in documenting APIs for clients. If you read the [Python standard library documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/), this is largely the method used to describe its APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another method is to specify our interfaces using code. Python provides a number of ways to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way is to (mis?)use inheritance by creating an **abstract base class** which specifies the interface.  Implementations would inherit directly from this. For example, we could define a `Stack` as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Stack:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def push(self, value):\n",
    "        \"\"\"push should accept a value, and add it to the top of the stack\"\"\"\n",
    "        raise NotImplementedError\n",
    "\n",
    "    def pop(self):\n",
    "        \"\"\"pop should remove the top value from the stack and return it\"\"\"\n",
    "        raise NotImplementedError\n",
    "\n",
    "    def peek(self):\n",
    "        \"\"\"peek should return the top element in the stack\"\"\"\n",
    "        raise NotImplementedError\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and our implementations could inherit from it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyStack(Stack):\n",
    "\n",
    "    def push(self, value):\n",
    "        ...  # real implementation code here\n",
    "\n",
    "    def pop(self):\n",
    "        ...  # real implementation code here\n",
    "\n",
    "    def peek(self):\n",
    "        ...  # real implementation code here\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Stack` class here serves two purposes.  The first is simply documentation: it is a place for the programmer to state precisely what a stack should do, including what methods it should provide, how many arguments each method takes, etc. The second is to provide the method implementations which raise `NotImplementedError`. The implementor should override all these methods in subclasses; if some method is not overridden in a subclass, then a client which uses that subclass will receive this raised exception when they call the method. `raise NotImplementedError` is an idiom in Python signaling to the client that the implementor of the class forgot to implement a required method.\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique has a downside, however. Suppose that the programmer forgets to implement `peek` in a Stack implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class BrokenStack(Stack):\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def push(self, value):\n",
    "        ...  # real implementation code here\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def pop(self):\n",
    "        ...  # real implementation code here\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This error will only be discovered when a client _actually executes_ a line of code that calls peek:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "s = BrokenStack()\n",
    "...\n",
    "# Much later, after running your analysis for 8 hours overnight,\n",
    "# the following line raises NotImplementedError, killing your job.\n",
    "# Oh well, hope you didn't have a deadline!\n",
    "v = s.peek()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interfaces** (sometimes called **protocols**) are important enough that many languages have explicit constructs for describing them. For example, Java has an `interface` declaration; C++ and many other languages have interface-like constructs as well. In some languages, we can verify that an interface is completely implemented _before_ we run the line of code that invokes an unimplemented method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has several idiomatic ways to describe interfaces. The most common, as we've already described, is simply English prose in doc comments, possibly accompanied with an abstract base class declaration of the type shown above. But it also has more advanced support for defining interfaces using abstract base classes in the `abc` package, which we'll describe in the next section."

    "### Abstract Base Classes using abc.ABC\n",
    "\n",
    "As a preface to this section, it is important to distinguish between the _concept_ of an abstract base class, and the Python `abc.ABC` construct.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've already described abstract base classes above. `Stack` is an abstract base class, because it is not meant to be instantiated directly (you would never want to write `s = Stack()`). _It exists only to be inherited from_ --- in particular, by implementations of the stack abstraction. Abstract base classes exist in almost all object-oriented programming languages, and they are implemented in a variety of ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "By contrast, Python `abc.ABC` classes are one mechanism that Python offers to define and enforce interfaces. It is somewhat unfortunate that this mechanism was called `abc.ABC` instead of `interface.Interface`.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that out of the way, let's get down to nuts and bolts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that every class has an implicit interface defined by its publicly accessible attributes (methods or data). This also includes dunder methods; while these are NOT publicly accessible, they control the external behavior on functions like `len` and `iter`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, a class's implicit interface is simply all there is. When you pass one of its instances to a function, that function uses some subset of that interface, and that is the only checking that is ever performed on it. This style of programming is called \"duck typing\": if an object quacks like a duck and walks like a duck, it might as well be a duck.  Similarly, if your function needs an object that has `quack` and `walk` methods, you don't care what object gets passed to you; you just call `quack` and `walk` and you're done.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, as the `NotImplementedError` in `peek` example from the previous section shows, sometimes we would like to know whether an object implements all of the methods we expect _before_ we actually run the code which calls those methods. In other words, we would like to check up-front whether the class's implicit interface conforms to some interface that we define elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use Python's `abc` package to define such interfaces, and to check whether classes implement them completely. We'll also \"mix-in\" `abc` classes into an implementation class to implement its behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do these work? We'll start with a short example:"

    "\n",
    ">On the other hand, it’s usually OK to perform an insinstance check against an ABC if you must enforce an API contract: “Dude, you have to implement this if you want to call me,” as technical reviewer Lennart Regebro put it. That’s particularly useful in systems that have a plug-in architecture. Outside of frameworks, duck typing is often sim‐ pler and more flexible than type checks.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Modularity\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind refactoring is to make sure we have no repeated code, everything is readable and testable, and most importantly, you have made it easier for future you. The usual direction this modularity goes in is to have many small classes and functions with loose coupling between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the pros and cons to this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- small classes/modules mean interfaces with only few abstract procedures.\n",
    "- thid means simple specs for interfaces\n",
    "- this also means invariants are local. What is this? For the many functions part of modularity we can judge and test what a function does independent of the other functions. Now, with AbsFun and RepInv, we can do the same for ADT.\n",
    "- Notice that this makes writing pre-and post-conditions harder. If you remember out binary search implementation we could have modularized it further, but communicating the pre-and-post conditions would have got harder with greater modularity. Still, remember how complex our binary-search spec was?.\n",
    "- the correctness is now easier to reason about and test on a per function and per-method basis\n",
    "- but we are less performant because we have many additional function calls. Also since everything is not at one place, its harder to play optimization tricks\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**You must exercise your own judgement** as to where you want to make this tradeoff between loose coupling/modularity and tight coupling/performance. As scientists, we are often exposed to the latter: a performant array for example precludes all sorts of nice streaming algorithms, duplicates memory, etc and makes things more monolithic. But where it is an advantage to ease of programming, it behooves us to choose narrow and nice interfaces. We'll see an example of this next time.\n"

    "Above we \"registered\" SimpleSet1 with the SimpleSetInterface ADT, and found that even without ANY explicit inheritance, SimpleSet1 was found to be a subclass of SimpleSet. This is very useful in python since Python supports multiple-inheritance, and we can thus \"mixin\" different protocols into what we do.\n",
    "\n",
    "On such registration, Python will just believe us without checking that we implement all the abstract methods. If we dont, we will gwt runtime exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you remember the `Answer` class from abovr which was a subclass of Sized? That wasnt even registered!\n",
