    "# ADTs\n",
    "\n",
    "Data structures can be viewed two ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In terms of their _concrete implementations_: for example, a fixed-size array, dynamic array, or linked list. These structures are defined by their representation in memory and the algorithms that implement their operations.\n",
    "2. In terms of what _abstract operations_ they support: for example, a stack might support `push`, `pop`, and `peek`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we take the latter view, we are considering the data structure as an **abstract data type (ADT)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "An ADT can have many potential implementations. For example, a stack can be implemented using arrays, linked lists, or even (in a contrived fashion) using dicts or numerous other underlying representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The O(n) performance of operations using any ADT implementation depends, of course, on the underlying representation, and how that representation is used to implement the ADT. Consider a stack implemented in two ways using a Python list:\n",
    "\n",
    "(A) Using the _front_ of the list as the \"top\" of the stack:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `push`: using Python list `insert` at index 0, takes O(N) time (we must shift all elements right)\n",
    "* `pop`: using Python `del` operator at index 0, takes O(N) time (we must shift remaining elements left)\n",
    "* `peek`: using Python indexing operator at index 0, takes O(1) time\n",
    "\n",
    "(B) Using the _back_ of the list as the \"top\" of the stack:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `push`: using Python list `append`, takes O(1) amortized time\n",
    "* `pop`: using Python list `pop`, takes O(1) amortized time\n",
    "* `peek`: using Python indexing operator at index 0, takes O(1) time\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, it's better to use the back as the top.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that although the _stack ADT_ operations can be phrased in terms of operations on the _Python list representation_, the two concepts are distinct; the stack is a facade or wrapper around the list. Code that that uses a stack --- the ADT's \"client\" --- should concern itself with the stack abstraction only, and have no access to the underlying list representation. In other words, the only code that should know about an an ADT implementation's representation is the implementation itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Protecting\" the representation of an abstraction from inappropriate access is called **encapsulation** or **information hiding**. Different programming languages have different ways of encapsulating abstractions. In Python, the most common way is to define a class, which keeps the representation \"hidden\" as one or more private fields of `self`. You can mark a field private by starting the name with one or two underscores:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyStack1:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self._rep = ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyStack2:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.__rep = ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the name \"rep\" is not special here; it is just a placeholder.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Aside: Some nitty-gritty Python details:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * Using one leading underscore for private fields is just a convention that has no special meaning to the Python interpreter, but signals to other programmers that client code should not touch these fields.\n",
    "> * Using two leading underscores instructs Python to \"mangle\" the name of this field so that it is hard to reference from outside of the class's members (but still possible).\n",
    ">\n",
    "> In either case, it is _possible_ for client code to access these fields, but only very bad programmers will access the private implementation of a Python class from outside that class (outside of certain situations like debugging or metaprogramming).\n",
    "\n",
    "Failing to encapsulate abstractions, or to respect abstraction boundaries, is **evil** --- using an **exposed representation** has several bad effects. The primary one is that it _tightly couples_ your client code to your implementation code. If you decide to change something about how your implementation works, such as changing a private variable name, you may accidentally break clients. Conversely, if client code reaches into the implementation and mutates something, it may break some invariant that the implementation was depending on, and this defect can be hard to track down.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't do it!\n",
    "\n",
    "Exercises to test your understanding:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How would you implement the three stack ADT operations using a singly linked list?\n",
    "* How would you implement a stack using a dict and a counter variable?\n",

    "### Specifying an ADT \n",
    "\n",
    "When you specify an ADT, you should **never** have anything about the representation leaking into your specification.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **specification** is a **collection of procedural abstractions**, not a collection of procedures. In other words, the specification describes _the externally observable behavior_ of the abstraction, not about how the code implementing the abstraction works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, an ADT specifies interfaces (APIs) to\n",
    "\n",
    "- construct the ADT\n",
    "- add, manipulate, and access values in the ADT\n",
    "- destroy the ADT, cleaning up its resources if necessary (note that since Python is a garbage collected language, often it does not require an explicit operation to destroy the ADT)\n",
    "\n",
    "How should we write down the ADT specification?\n",
    "\n",
    "One way is the way we've used so far: to write it down in prose. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we could just say that a stack is a sequence supporting insertion and removal at one end. But this is fairly vague. Given this description, we have very little guidance on how to implement this abstraction (for example, what should the method names be called?), and equally little on how to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we wanted greater precision, we could list the methods by name, state their arguments, and precisely specify what each method should do. Often this is what we do in documenting APIs for clients. If you read the [Python standard library documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/), this is mostly how Python's standard APIs are described.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another method is to specify our interfaces using code. Python provides a number of ways to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way is to (mis?)use inheritance by creating an **abstract base class** which specifies the interface.  Implementations would inherit directly from this. For example, we could define a `Stack` as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Stack:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def push(self, value):\n",
    "        \"\"\"push should accept a value, and add it to the top of the stack\"\"\"\n",
    "        raise NotImplementedError\n",
    "\n",
    "    def pop(self):\n",
    "        \"\"\"pop should remove the top value from the stack and return it\"\"\"\n",
    "        raise NotImplementedError\n",
    "\n",
    "    def peek(self):\n",
    "        \"\"\"peek should return the top element in the stack\"\"\"\n",
    "        raise NotImplementedError\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and our implementations could inherit from it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyStack(Stack):\n",
    "\n",
    "    def push(self, value):\n",
    "        ...  # real implementation code here\n",
    "\n",
    "    def pop(self):\n",
    "        ...  # real implementation code here\n",
    "\n",
    "    def peek(self):\n",
    "        ...  # real implementation code here\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Stack` class here serves two purposes.  The first is simply documentation: it is a place for the programmer to state precisely what a stack should do, including what methods it should provide, how many arguments each method takes, etc. The second is to provide the method implementations which raise `NotImplementedError`. The implementor should override all these methods in subclasses; if some method is not overridden in a subclass, then a client which uses that subclass will receive this raised exception when they call the method. `raise NotImplementedError` is an idiom in Python signaling to the client that the implementor of the class forgot to implement a required method.\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique has a downside, however. Suppose that the programmer forgets to implement `peek` in a Stack implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class BrokenStack(Stack):\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def push(self, value):\n",
    "        ...  # real implementation code here\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def pop(self):\n",
    "        ...  # real implementation code here\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This error will only be discovered when a client _actually executes_ a line of code that calls peek:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "s = BrokenStack()\n",
    "...\n",
    "# Much later, after running your analysis for 8 hours overnight,\n",
    "# the following line raises NotImplementedError, killing your job.\n",
    "# Oh well, hope you didn't have a deadline!\n",
    "v = s.peek()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interfaces** (sometimes called **protocols**) are important enough that many languages have explicit constructs for describing them. For example, Java has an `interface` declaration; C++ and many other languages have interface-like constructs as well. In some languages, we can verify that an interface is completely implemented _before_ we run the line of code that invokes an unimplemented method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has several idiomatic ways to describe interfaces. The most common, as we've already described, is simply English prose in doc comments, possibly accompanied with an abstract base class declaration of the type shown above. But it also has more advanced support for defining interfaces using abstract base classes in the `abc` package, which we'll describe in the next section."

    "### Abstract Base Classes using abc.ABC\n",
    "\n",
    "As a preface to this section, it is important to distinguish between the _concept_ of an abstract base class, and the Python `abc.ABC` construct.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've already described abstract base classes above. `Stack` is an abstract base class, because it is not meant to be instantiated directly (you would never want to write `s = Stack()`). _It exists only to be inherited from_ --- in particular, by implementations of the stack abstraction. Abstract base classes exist in almost all object-oriented programming languages, and they are implemented in a variety of ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "By contrast, Python `abc.ABC` classes are one mechanism that Python offers to define and enforce interfaces. It is somewhat unfortunate that this mechanism was called `abc.ABC` instead of `interface.Interface`.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that out of the way, let's get down to nuts and bolts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that every class has an implicit interface defined by its publicly accessible attributes (methods or data). This also includes dunder methods; while these are NOT publicly accessible, they control the external behavior on functions like `len` and `iter`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, a class's implicit interface is simply all there is. When you pass one of its instances to a function, that function uses some subset of that interface, and that is the only checking that is ever performed on it. This style of programming is called \"duck typing\": if an object quacks like a duck and walks like a duck, it might as well be a duck.  Similarly, if your function needs an object that has `quack` and `walk` methods, you don't care what object gets passed to you; you just call `quack` and `walk` and you're done.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, as the `NotImplementedError` in `peek` example from the previous section shows, sometimes we would like to know whether an object implements all of the methods we expect _before_ we actually run the code which calls those methods. In other words, we would like to check up-front whether the class's implicit interface conforms to some interface that we define elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use Python's `abc` package to define such interfaces, and to check whether classes implement them completely.\n",
    "\n",

    "> > On the other hand, it’s usually OK to perform an insinstance check against an ABC if you must enforce an API contract: “Dude, you have to implement this if you want to call me,” as technical reviewer Lennart Regebro put it. That’s particularly useful in systems that have a plug-in architecture. Outside of frameworks, duck typing is often sim‐ pler and more flexible than type checks.\n",

    "\n",
    "The abstract function of an ADT ascribes meaning to our representation. That is, it maps the concrete representation (here a list) to the abstract value (a set). It helps us, the implementors, reason from the client perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the client perspective? Recall that earlier, we said that clients should deal with an ADT in terms of its abstract operations, not its implementation. `SimpleSet1` uses a list with possibly-repeated values to implement a set with guaranteed-unique values. The fact that the list may contain repeated values must remain invisible to the client, and (provided we implement the class correctly) this information is successfully hidden.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementer, of course, must know exactly how various possible states of the _list representation_ map to states of the _set abstraction_; this loss of information is described by the abstraction function.\n",

    "Also, in general, some states (possible values) of an ADT implementation's representation may be invalid for the abstraction function. Again, to phrase this in set-theoretic terms, the abstraction function may be a partial function (some values in the domain may not map to any in the range). In our `SimpleSet1` this is not the case --- every possible state of its _rep_ has a valid interpretation as a set --- but we will see an example of a partial abstraction function shortly."

There does not seem to be any way except for the *abstraction function* to reason about what elements a set contains when a list has a certain state. Indeed, perhaps the only way we might have been able to catch the deletion formally would have been to impose a post-condition on the deletion that ALL values corresponding to the asked-for deletion in the list implementation were removed.\n",

How do we know that it's safe to omit the check? Neither the code nor the `AbsFun` state that the list must contain no duplicates. Therefore, the reader certainly can't determine whether `__len__` is implemented correctly just by looking at `__len__`. In fact, an implementor needs to go digging through the code of the entire class, and somehow infer the implicit intention that items in the list should be unique, before they even think about determining whether `__len__` is correct.\n",

    "### Representation Invariant (RI)\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, we must write down, somewhere and somehow, the fact that the list should contain no duplicates.  A constraint like this is called a **representation invariant**; we will abbreviate this sometimes as RI or `RepInv`. The constraint is called a representation invariant because _it describes something that should always be true about the representation_, before and after every public method call.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, a representation invariant tells us what must hold across all possible sequences of method calls on an implementation. For example, in `SimpleSet2`, we want the fact that the list has no duplicates to be preserved by public operations. No matter what our client does with us, we want the RI to be preserved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Crucially, because every public operation preserves the representation invariant, _every public method can rely on it being true_ on entry to the method. This enables so-called **local reasoning**; you can check whether a method is correctly implemented just by reading the RI and the code of the method. For example, given the RI that all list values are unique, we know that the `__len__` method does not have to check for duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for this to work, the RI must capture whatever properties we must maintain on the underlying data structure to behave correctly with respect to our external interface. To put it yet another way, the RI tells us which concrete data is valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "For `SimpleSet2`, an English statement of the representation invariant would be something like this: \"All values in `self._storage` are unique.\"\n",

    "#### Representation Invariants and Abstraction FUnctions\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall above, in the section on abstraction functions, we mentioned that the abstraction function might be partial. In `SimpleSet2`, we have an example: some values of the underlying list representation do not behave properly with respect to the set interface; namely, list values containing duplicates. This is why our representation invariant states that all list values are unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, then, the representation invariant is exactly how we state which representations are valid values in the domain of the abstraction function. The nature of the RI can be captured now in this diagram:\n",

    "Notice that using `repOK` in conjunction with testing saves the day. It often much easier to catch a representation invariant violation when it first occurs, rather than debugging a mysterious failure or broken behavior that occurs later but was ultimately caused by corruption of the representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, it is difficult to define a representation invariant on our initial write of the code. However, once you have a rough idea of how the code should work, refactoring with a clear representation invariant in mind can get you quite far. The general process of refactoring involves making yourself DRY, and more generally refactoring larger functions into smaller, testable ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A caveat re: performance\n",
    "\n",
    "`repOK` is O(N^2): we iterate through the entire list (O(N)), and on each iteration we check whether each item is present in the output list (also O(N) --- the `in` operator on lists must iterate over the entire list).\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, calling `repOK` all the time in production code may slow things down too much. Whether to keep invariant checks in or not is often a judgment call; you will often have to balance comprehensiveness of checking against performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few techniques for keeping invariant checking overhead down.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we can simply omit the calls on some methods. In the above code, we call `repOK` at least once in every public method that mutates the representation. If we were really aiming for maximum checking, we might want to add the checks in read-only methods (like `__len__`) as well: a typo or other error could cause us to mutate the representation by accident in a read-only method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we can put the checks behind a debug flag:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class SimpleSet2:\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Set this to False in programs that rely critically on SimpleSet2 performance\n",
    "    CHECK_REP_OK = True\n",
    "\n",
    "    ...  # as before, but then:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def add(self, item):\n",
    "        if item not in repOK(self._storage):\n",
    "            self._storage.append(item)\n",
    "        if CHECK_REP_OK:\n",
    "            repOK(self._storage)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ...  # and analogously for other operations\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is somewhat cumbersome, as it forces programmers to potentially turn off checks in every abstraction they use. In practice, programmers usually try to keep invariant checking cheap in production code, and perform exhaustive, expensive invariant checking only in tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Aside: Some nitty-gritty Python details: Python usually runs in debug mode. In debug mode, `assert` statements are evaluated as usual. But it is also possible to run python in optimized mode using `python -O`; in this mode, `assert` statements are not executed at all. This technique can be used as a \"standard\" way of disabling expensive checks.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> However, `assert` is often used for cheap checks that should always be on, so running with all assertions disabled in production is often a recipe for allowing sneaky bugs to creep into your production systems undetected.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Furthermore, disabling assertions is not a panacea for eliminating expensive checks. Notice how, in our `repOK` function, we do a substantial amount of work before the `assert` statement --- indeed, all the expensive work occurs in the loop above it. Running in optimized mode would not eliminate any substantial cost from the `repOK` check. It would, however, disable the actual enforcement part --- the worst of all worlds!\n",
    "\n",
    "A final alternative is to leave the `repOK` around in comments. This tends to clutter up your code for little gain, but it does preserve some documentation that the invariant should be preserved. Personally, I do not recommend it:"

    "## Modularity\n",
    "\n",
    "[This section is probably a mistake. There is no way anyone who is not a deeply experienced programmer is going to understand this material from a presentation this short. Tradeoffs in modularity should be its own lecture.]\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind refactoring is to make sure we have no repeated code, everything is readable and testable, and most importantly, you have made it easier for future you. The usual direction this modularity goes in is to have many small classes and functions with loose coupling between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the pros and cons to this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- small classes/modules mean interfaces with only few abstract procedures.\n",
    "- simple specs for interfaces\n",
    "- invariants are local. What is this? For the many functions part of modularity we can judge and test what a function does independent of the other functions. Now, with AbsFun and RepInv, we can do the same for ADT.\n",
    "- Notice that this makes writing pre-and post-conditions harder. If you remember out binary search implementation we could have modularized it further, but communicating the pre-and-post conditions would have got harder with greater modularity. Still, remember how complex our binary-search spec was?.\n",
    "- the correctness is now easier to reason about and test on a per function and per-method basis\n",
    "- but we are less performant because we have many additional function calls. Also since everything is not at one place, its harder to play optimization tricks\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**You must exercise your own judgement** as to where you want to make this tradeoff between loose coupling/modularity and tight coupling/performance. As scientists, we are often exposed to the latter: a performant array for example precludes all sorts of nice streaming algorithms, duplicates memory, etc and makes things more monolithic. But where it is an advantage to ease of programming, it behooves us to choose narrow and nice interfaces. We'll see an example of this next time.\n"

This works because `SimpleSetInterface` has the `abc.ABC` metaclass; using this metaclass gives `SimpleSetInterface` the `register` class method, which in turn does the right incantations behind the scenes to tell Python that its argument is a subclass of the class it's called on.\n",

    "issubclass(Answer, Sized)\n",
    "```\n",
